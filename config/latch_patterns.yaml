# Latch/Sequential Cell Identification Configuration
# =================================================
#
# This file configures pattern matching for detecting sequential cells
# (latches, flip-flops) in gate-level netlists.
#
# The configuration is used by the LatchDetectorService to identify cells
# that should serve as expansion boundaries during schematic exploration.
#
# Pattern Syntax (Glob-Style):
# ----------------------------
#   *     - Matches any sequence of characters (including none)
#   ?     - Matches any single character
#
# Examples:
#   "*DFF*"    - Matches: DFFR_X1, SDFFR_X2, DFF_POS, SCAN_DFF
#   "*LATCH*"  - Matches: LATCH_X1, DLATCH_X2, HLATCH
#   "FF*"      - Matches: FF_X1, FF_X2 (but not JKFF_X1)
#   "*_REG"    - Matches: D_REG, SCAN_REG
#   "DFF_?"    - Matches: DFF_1, DFF_2 (single char after underscore)
#
# Pattern Order:
# --------------
# Patterns are checked in order from top to bottom.
# Place more specific patterns before broader ones for efficiency.
# The first matching pattern wins.
#
# Case Sensitivity:
# -----------------
# By default, matching is case-insensitive to handle varying
# library conventions (DFFR_X1 vs dffr_x1 vs Dffr_X1).
# Set case_sensitive: true if exact case matching is required.
#
# Common Cell Library Naming Conventions:
# ---------------------------------------
#   Standard Cell Libraries:  DFFR_X1, DFFR_X2, SDFFR_X1
#   D Latches:                LATCH_X1, DLATCH_X2
#   Generic Flip-Flops:       FF_POS, FF_NEG
#   Scan Flip-Flops:          SDFF_X1, SCAN_DFF
#   JK/SR Flip-Flops:         JKFF_X1, SRFF_X1
#
# Customization:
# --------------
# Edit the patterns list below to match your cell library's naming.
# Restart the application after making changes.

  # Order: specific patterns first, broader patterns last
  patterns:
    - "*DFF*"      # D flip-flops (DFFR_X1, SDFFR_X2, DFF_POS, SCAN_DFF, etc.)
    - "*LATCH*"    # Latch elements (LATCH_X1, DLATCH_X2, HLATCH, etc.)
    - "*FF*"       # Generic flip-flops - broader fallback (JKFF, SRFF, FF_X1, etc.)

  # Case-insensitive matching (recommended for robustness)
  # Set to true if your library uses strict case conventions
  case_sensitive: false
