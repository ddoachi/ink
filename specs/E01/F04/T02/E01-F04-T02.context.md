# Context: E01-F04-T02

## Pre-Implementation Discussions
- **2025-12-27**: Looking at the spec, the 'latch detecting' is kind of name-based way. But the name-based method is insufficient. Can we detect the latch by circuit topology?
- **2025-12-27**: Even pin names could not be 'CLK', 'D', or 'Q' - standard pin names are also not guaranteed. Need detection that doesn't rely on naming conventions at all.
- **2025-12-27**: Latch topologies aren't just cross-coupled NAND/NOR. Also need to detect transmission gate latches (TG + inverter + feedback inverter) and tristate inverter latches - both common in CMOS.
- **2025-12-27**: Question: Can we parse a SPICE netlist of a custom latch and auto-detect it? Yes! Need a Topology Extractor that builds connection graph from subcircuit internals and feeds into the latch identifier. This bridges CDL parsing with topology-based detection.
- **2025-12-27**: Decision: Separate transistor-level analysis into E01-F04-T04 (Transistor Topology Analyzer). E01-F04-T02 focuses on the detection algorithm (DFS cycle detection), while E01-F04-T04 handles transistor pattern recognition (inverter, TG, NAND, NOR extraction).

## Spec Revisions
- **2025-12-27 v0.2**: Major revision - Changed from name-based pattern matching to topology-based detection with feedback loop analysis as primary strategy. Added explicit annotation support. Reordered detection priority: Feedback Loop > Explicit > Pin Signature > Pattern Match.
