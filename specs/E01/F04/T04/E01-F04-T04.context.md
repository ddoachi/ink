# Context: E01-F04-T04

## Pre-Implementation Discussions
- **2025-12-27**: Created as split from E01-F04-T02 discussion. Gate-level CDL netlists include transistor-level descriptions of latches. Need to analyze transistor patterns (inverter, TG, NAND, NOR) to extract signal flow graph for feedback detection.
- **2025-12-27**: Key patterns: Inverter (complementary PMOS/NMOS, gate=input, drain=output), Transmission Gate (shared source/drain, bidirectional), NAND (parallel PMOS + series NMOS), NOR (series PMOS + parallel NMOS).
